does tenuto eighths contradict slurs over them?

r8 d d tenuto in french horn might want to be d8 d d

baritone part is kind of a euphonium 2 part, lower in pitches.

The symphony orchestra arrangement has a lot more expressive markings.

We replaced quarter tied to an eighth note, typically a convention for full length of note, with dotted quarter to save space.


todo: hidden grace notes
remove backslashed slurs and beamings
remove spurious forte at beginning
symphonic expressive markings
* slurs on syncopated rhythms
* at 2, tenuto instead of accent (accents remain at 3)
* at 2, get rid of slurred tenuto
* at 3 add tenuto on 2 and 4th measures
consider 1977 dynamics
transpose
squash

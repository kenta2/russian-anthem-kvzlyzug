r8 d d tenuto in french horn might want to be d8 d d

baritone part is kind of a euphonium 2 part, lower in pitches.

We replaced quarter tied to an eighth note, typically a convention for full length of note, with dotted quarter to save space.


did 1977 dynamics:
ff at intro, then f in theme
mf cresc start at pick up to 5th half note of main theme into (add)f 1
* this moves the cresc earlier
ff at 2 (already done).  only some parts have the hairpin cresc before
mf 2 measures before 3, cresc later in the measure to ff at 3
(parts significantly differ about this..., i'm surprised I didn't catch it earlier)
fff at end


remove dotted quarter slurs (probably not)


change bottom margin

Conduct in 4 throughout so we don't have to pay attention to time
signature change.

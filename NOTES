r8 d d tenuto in french horn might want to be d8 d d

baritone part is kind of a euphonium 2 part, lower in pitches.

We replaced quarter tied to an eighth note, typically a convention for full length of note, with dotted quarter to save space.


consider 1977 dynamics
ff at intro, then f in theme
mf cresc start at pick up to 5th half note of main theme into (add)f 1
* this moves the cresc earlier
ff at 2 (already done).  only some parts have the hairpin cresc before
mf 2 measures before 3, cresc later in the measure to ff at 3
(parts significantly differ about this..., i'm surprised I didn't catch it earlier)
fff at end

consider removing tenorsax, basson, etc moving 8th slurs, because they are probably phrasing slurs.

consider reverting dotted quarter into quarter tied to eighth, or else the crescendo does not make a lot of sense.

remove dotted quarter slurs (probably not)

consider changing halfnote at end of first ending to dotted quarter

change bottom margin

Conduct in 4 throughout so we don't have to pay attention to time
signature change.
